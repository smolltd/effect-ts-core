/**
 * Designed to be used while applying changes to certain types of persistent structures. Often the
 * details about whether anything internal was actually changed cannot be determined until after a
 * new structure has been created, and sometimes the magnitude of the change needs to be captured as
 * well, usually for updating the stored size of the structure, for fast lookup. If after performing
 * one or more operations no change has been confirmed, the original structure can be returned and
 * the newly-created instances, to which changes would have been applied, can be discarded.
 *
 * `ChangeFlag` is designed to be used temporarily and then released so that it can be cached for
 * efficient reuse, thus avoiding a lot of unnecessary additional object allocations while
 * operations are being performed.
